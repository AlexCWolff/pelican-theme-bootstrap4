This is the Pelican theme I made for my website, uses Bootstrap 4 and strips out a lot of extra stuff I didn't want cluttering up my site. 

If you want the blogroll, github, twitter, and links features you will have to modify this.

Uses CDN for the Bootstrap files and Open Sans font with local fallback.

I will probably keep this updated as Bootstrap 4 moves out of alpha.
